# Task 1: Laying the Foundation for Brent Oil Price Analysis

## Objective
Establish a clear analysis plan and foundational understanding for applying change point detection to Brent oil price data.

## Contents
- *Brent Oil Dataset** (CSV): Daily historical prices
- **Event Data** (CSV): Key geopolitical, economic, and OPEC-related events with dates
- **Interim Report**: Describes the planned analysis steps and key assumptions

## Key Steps
1. Define analysis workflow for Brent oil price data
2. Compile structured event dataset (15+ key events)
3. Analyze time series properties (trend, stationarity)
4. Understand and explain change point models
5. Identify assumptions, limitations, and the correlation vs. causation gap
6. Plan communication formats (e.g., visual plots, reports)

## Output
Prepared data, annotated plots, and a foundation for modeling structural changes in oil prices.
